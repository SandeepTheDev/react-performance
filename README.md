# How react actually works?

React rendering cycle can be divided into three following phases..

### Render phase

Whenever the state of application changed React create a Virtual DOM with updated state and compares it with previous Virtual DOM and calculate the changes that needs to be commited to the DOM this process is known as diffing.

### Commit phase

During this phase React commit the calculated changes to the real DOM. **Refs** also gets updated during this phase **ref always points the same object between render phase and commit phase**.

### Clean up phase

This the last step where clean up occurs.

ğŸ‘‰ between commit phase and clean up phase useEffect happens..

> ğŸ’¡ **The only thing that cause re-render is whenever the state changed**.
